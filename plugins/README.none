none.pl - Plugin for mootykins3
===============================

This plugin simply does nothing. When called, it does not respond at all. It's there so you can use it like this:

[mootykins::servers::example]
plugins = this,that,etcetera
channels = #example

[mootykins::channels::example::#example]
plugins = none
